In my ten years of professional experience, I've worked for both startups and large corporate enterprises. I've built
various solutions, from office IT systems and e-commerce value chains to microcontroller programming.

With this expertise, I can support your project by developing tailored strategies and assembling the right team for implementation.

The following list provides an excerpt of my previous involvements:

* **Freelance projects** - IT solutions and consulting
  *2010 - now*
* **Software development** at [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/de/de/home.html)  
  *2022 - now*  
  At Thermo Fisher, I work in an interdisciplinary team of developers and scientists to implement a complex web application for analyzing mass spectra in proteomics. I am responsible for significant parts of the overall system, developed in Go, .NET/C#, and Vue.js. The platform is deployed on Kubernetes and managed with ArgoCD.
* **Founding** the collectively organized software agency [ctrl.alt.coop](https://ctrl.alt.coop)  
  *2018 - 2022*  
  I founded a software cooperative and grew it to ten members. Together, we delivered numerous projects for diverse clients. Depending on the assignment, we used a variety of technologies – including Django, Vue.js, Android SDK (Kotlin), and Kubernetes.
* **Software development** at [unu](https://unumotors.com/)  
  *2016 - 2018*  
  At the e-scooter manufacturer unu, I developed the entire fulfillment system together with two colleagues. This included a headless e-commerce backend in Django, an elegant checkout in Vue.js, and integrations with Salesforce, logistics providers, the spare parts system, the customer portal, and marketing.
* **Software development** at [T-Systems MMS](https://www.t-systems-mms.com/)  
  *2016 - 2016*  
  Contributed to a large-scale internal invoicing project by developing a complex form validation system in AngularJS. 
* **Software development** at ubimake (startup in the 3D industry, †2017)  
  *2014 - 2016*  
  Ubimake emerged during the 3D-printing hype with the goal of creating an interactive workbench for hobby makers – essentially a CAD tool for beginners with direct integration to a 3D-printing service provider. I contributed across the entire stack, from 3D development with Three.js to backend integration.
* **Software development** at [TwoTickets.de](https://www.twotickets.de/)  
  *2013 - 2014*  
  Implemented new features for the company’s ticket lottery portal (Python/Django). My most notable contribution was an algorithm that distributed free tickets according to member preferences.
* **Software development** at [arTec GmbH](https://artec-berlin.de/)  
  *2011 - 2013*  
  Worked on a library visualization tool. A highlight was implementing a path visualization feature, which allowed me to apply my knowledge of depth-first search algorithms. Technologies used: PHP and ActionScript (Flash).
* **Computer Science studies** at the "Freie Universität Berlin"  
  2011 - 2014
